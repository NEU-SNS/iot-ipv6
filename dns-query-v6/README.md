# Active DNS Query Experiments

Scripts for performing active DNS queries and analyzing the results.

### Running the Query Script
You can run the DNS query using either the Python or Go script (only one is needed):

```bash
python3 dns_query.py
```

Alternatively, the same functionality is implemented in Go: dns_query.go
Use `dns_analysis.ipynb` to analyze the DNS query results.
